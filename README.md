# chimedb.dataflag - CHIME data flagging tools

This package, built on top of [chimedb.core](https://github.com/chime-experiment/chimedb), defines the
data flagging tables, and provides tools for adding flags to the database.

## Installing

Install directly from GitHub:
```
pip install git+ssh://git@github.com/chime-experiment/chimedb_dataflag.git
```

If, instead, you're installing from a local clone, read the installation instructions in the
[chimedb.core README.md](https://github.com/chime-experiment/chimedb/) for an important caveat.
